    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past two decades, rising inflation has reshaped the financial realities of everyday life—especially in rapidly growing urban centers like Seattle. While wage growth is frequently cited as a marker of economic prosperity, it often fails to keep pace with the soaring costs of essentials such as housing, transportation, and food. This growing disconnect between nominal income and actual purchasing power raises a critical question: <strong>Is life really more affordable today than it was twenty years ago?</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This project explores that question by visualizing how inflation has impacted the real purchasing power of Seattle residents. Using a combination of time-series charts, slope graphs, and interactive dashboards, we aim to bridge the gap between economic indicators and lived experiences.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Project Goals and Structure</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Section 1 – Real Wages in Seattle</strong><br>
        <em>Goal:</em> Reveal how wage trends in key industries have evolved when adjusted for inflation.<br>
        <em>Approach:</em> Interactive line charts will display real vs. nominal wage growth across sectors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Section 2 – What’s Driving the Cost of Living?</strong><br>
        <em>Goal:</em> Break down which components - housing, food, transportation - are contributing most to cost increases.<br>
        <em>Approach:</em> Stacked area charts and interactive category filters will highlight disparities in price growth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Section 3 – Affordability Over Time</strong><br>
        <em>Goal:</em> Translate economic metrics into real-world meaning by showing what a paycheck can buy today compared to the past.<br>
        <em>Approach:</em> Ratio-based visuals will illustrate how many eggs, gallons of gas, or square feet of rent an hour of work buys.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Section 4 – Cross-City Comparison</strong><br>
        <em>Goal:</em> Contextualize Seattle’s trends within the broader national landscape.<br>
        <em>Approach:</em> Comparative visualizations with cities like NYC, SF, and LA will help assess whether Seattle’s affordability crisis is unique or part of a wider pattern.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    
    <p>
      By transforming complex datasets into clear, accessible visuals, this dashboard will help policymakers, researchers, and residents alike understand the evolving economics of living in Seattle. The result is not just a collection of charts — but a narrative about affordability and economic resilience in the face of inflation.
